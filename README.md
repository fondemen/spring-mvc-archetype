# spring-mvc-archetype
An extremely simple Spring MVC + Hibernate 4 archetype, configured with NO XML.

This archetype is an enhanced version (fork of) co.ntier:spring-mvc-archetype:1.0.2.
Its goal, as the origin, is to provide a simple archetype to start a Spring MVC based project. Compared to co.ntier:spring-mvc-archetype:1.0.2, it uses a more recent version of Spring, explicitly adds a dependency to an application server (so far tomcat 7), and includes an example integration test.
